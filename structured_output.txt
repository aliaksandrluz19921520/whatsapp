### Health and Safety Orders (Title 8: Industrial Relations)

#### Overview of Cal/OSHA
California administers its own program for workers' health and safety via the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal/OSHA). It oversees almost every worker in the State except for federal employees. Cal/OSHA is approved and monitored by the federal OSHA program.

Cal/OSHA is administered by the California Department of Industrial Relations. Within that department, the Division of Occupational Safety and Health (DOSH) has the authority to enforce all regulations concerning worker safety and health on the job.

#### Location of Cal/OSHA Laws
You will find the laws concerned with Cal/OSHA in Title 8 (Industrial Relations) of the California Code of Regulations, which contains regulations governing state agencies. Safety laws are found in one chapter of Title 8 called "Division of Industrial Safety." Key subchapters include:
- **Construction Safety Orders (CSO) (Subchapter 4):** Especially important for contractors.
- **General Industry Safety Orders (GISO) (Subchapter 7):** Contains several laws summarized here.
- **Electrical Safety Orders (Subchapter 5):** Regulates specialty contractors.
- **Elevator Safety Orders (Subchapter 6):** Regulates specialty contractors.

If you are a contractor in the building trades, the CSO takes precedence over other orders. If a topic is not mentioned in the CSO, you are also regulated by the other orders. The updated official orders are the final authority, taking precedence over this manual or any Cal/OSHA informational leaflet.

#### Injury & Illness Prevention Program (IIPP)
Every employer must have a written IIPP that includes at least the following:
1. Identification of the person(s) responsible for implementing the IIPP.
2. A system to ensure that employees comply with health and safety practices. The system includes recognition, (re)training, and/or disciplinary actions.
3. A system for communicating with workers. For 10 or more employees, communication must be in writing. Exception: oral communication is allowed if there are fewer than 10 employees.
4. A system to identify and evaluate workplace hazards.
5. A system to investigate work-related injuries and illnesses.
6. A system to correct unsafe or unhealthy conditions.
7. A system to provide training to employees.

### Safety Practices in the Construction Industry

#### Safety Meetings
- "Tailgate" or "toolbox" safety meetings of supervisors with employees must be held at least every 10 working days.
- Safety meetings of management with supervisors are recommended to be held on at least a monthly basis.

#### Code of Safe Practices
Every employer must adopt a written Code of Safe Practices that includes general and specific procedures relevant to the employer's business. Cal/OSHA will provide a model code.

### Administrative Requirements under Cal/OSHA

#### Cal/OSHA Recordkeeping and Reporting
- Every employer of more than 10 full- or part-time employees must keep written records and make reports as outlined in the booklet "A Brief Guide to Recordkeeping Requirements for Occupational Injuries and Illnesses."
- Most records must be kept for 5 years, but if they concern an agent with a long-term health hazard, they must be kept for 30 years.
- Employers must report any work-related fatality, serious injury, serious illness, or blasting accident immediately by phone or telegraph to the nearest district office of the Division of Occupational Safety and Health (DOSH).
  - A "serious" injury or illness is one for which an employee is hospitalized for more than 24 hours for other than medical observation, or in which an employee suffers loss of any member of the body or suffers any serious permanent disfigurement.
  - "Immediately" means as soon as practically possible but no longer than 8 hours after the employer knows or should have known about the event.

#### Permits
You must obtain a DOSH permit for:
- Construction of trenches or excavations 5 feet or deeper that workers must enter.
- Construction or demolition of any building, structure, scaffolding, or falsework more than three stories high (one story = 12 feet).
- Construction elevators.
- All large and some small air tanks.

Most permits can be obtained from any DOSH district or field office, including permits on an annual basis.

### Certification of Power-Operated Cranes, Derricks, and Cableways
Cranes, derricks, and cableways larger than 3 tons rated capacity must not be used in lifting service until the equipment has been certified by a DOSH-approved certifying agent.

### Hazardous Substances
The employer must provide workers with "Safety Data Sheets" (SDSs) and training when using any substance listed in the "List of Hazardous Substances" developed by the Director of the Department of Industrial Relations.

### Access to Medical/Exposure Records
The employer must make records available within 15 days of a request by the worker or the worker's representative. Extensions of time for good cause may be granted by the Chief of DOSH.

### Blaster's License
Every blasting operation requires a licensed blaster to be present and/or to direct others.

### Powder-Actuated Tool Certificate
No one may operate a powder-actuated tool until he or she has received training as prescribed by the manufacturer and carries a valid operator's card for the tool.

### Work Areas
- Scrap lumber and debris must be kept reasonably clear of work surfaces, passageways, and stairs.
- Ground areas within 6 feet of buildings under construction must be kept reasonably free from irregularities.
- Storage areas and walkways on construction sites must be maintained reasonably free of dangerous depressions, obstructions, and debris.
- Piled or stacked material must be placed in stable stacks to prevent it from falling, slipping, or collapsing.
- The face of a pile of cement bags more than 5 feet high must be tapered back.
- Lumber piles must not be higher than 16 feet if the lumber is handled manually, or 20 feet if handled with equipment.

### Personal Protective Equipment

#### Eye and Face Protection
Eye protection or face shields are required where there is an inherent probability of eye injury from flying particles or from light rays.

#### Foot Protection
Foot protection is required when workers are exposed to foot injury from hot, corrosive, or poisonous substances, or from falling objects.

#### Hand Protection
Hand protection is required for workers exposed to cuts, burns, electrical current, or corrosive or irritating substances.

#### Body Protection
- Loose clothing, such as sleeves, ties, and cuffs, must not be worn around machinery in which it could become entangled.
- Workers must not wear clothing saturated with flammable liquids or corrosive or oxidizing agents.

#### Hearing Protection
- Employers must monitor noise and administer a hearing conservation program when noise exposure is 85 dB or more.
- Noise levels above 90 dBA are potentially damaging and are frequent in many construction operations. If noise exposures cannot be reduced to the allowable level, employees must wear acceptable hearing protection.
- For every 5 dBA above 90 dBA, the maximum allowed daily exposure decreases by one-half.

**Noise Exposure Limits:**
| Sound Level (dBA) | Max Time Per Day |
|-------------------|------------------|
| 90                | 8 hours          |
| 95                | 4 hours          |
| 100               | 2 hours          |
| 105               | 1 hour           |
| 110               | 1/2 hour         |

### Head Protection
- Employees exposed to flying or falling objects must wear approved head protection.
- Hard hats should be worn by everyone at a construction site.
- Long hair must be confined if there is a chance of entangling it in machinery, combustibles, or toxic contaminants.

### Respiratory Protection
- If engineering or operational controls are not practical to limit harmful exposure to airborne contaminants, a NIOSH- or MSHA-approved respirator must be worn by exposed employees.
- Employees must wear air-supplying respirators:
  - During blasting when dust may exceed limits specified in the General Industry Safety Orders (GISO).
  - During blasting with silica sand.
  - Where oxygen concentration falls below 19.5%.
  - Where toxic material is present.
- Employees must not be assigned to work requiring respirators unless they are physically able to work in one, as determined by a licensed physician.

### Occupational Health

#### Chemical Contaminants
Chemical contaminants are listed in the GISO, Sec. 5155.

#### Exhaust Emission
In addition to dilution ventilation or exhaust collection, an approved purifier device is required if emission exceeds the maximum acceptable concentration.

#### Carcinogens
The employer must report to the Chief of DOSH any operations involving carcinogenic (cancer-causing) chemicals and any incident of possible exposure to a carcinogen within 15 days.

### Wood Preservative Chemicals
- The commonly used wood preservatives contain creosote, inorganic arsenic, or pentachlorophenol.
- Where the probability of skin or eye irritation exists, workers must use appropriate protective clothing and equipment such as coveralls, gloves, shoes, face shields, or impervious clothing.
- Use of appropriate respirators is required when it is impractical to eliminate harmful exposures to these chemicals.

### Asbestos
- An employer must report any anticipated operation or processes involving asbestos or asbestos-containing products to the Chief of DOSH.
- If material containing more than 0.1% asbestos (dry weight) is sanded, ground, blasted, sawed, cut, shoveled, removed, or handled so as to produce dust during construction, repair, demolition, or salvage activities, it must also be reported to the Chief of DOSH.
- The spraying of materials containing asbestos is prohibited, except for:
  - Cold asphalt.
  - Coatings containing bound asbestos fibers.
- Work practices when using asbestos:
  - Vacuum cleaners with HEPA filters must be used.
  - Asbestos must be handled wet, if possible. Materials must be wetted before removal from containers unless exposure is controlled by ventilation.
  - Asbestos waste and debris must be collected in sealed impermeable (leak-proof) bags.
  - Respiratory protection for workers is required.
  - All material or scrap containing asbestos must be labeled.
  - A training program is required for employees involved with asbestos: at the time of first hiring and at yearly intervals thereafter, except for certified asbestos workers.
  - Initial and repeat medical exams must be given to workers exposed to asbestos.
- An employee must not be exposed to a concentration of airborne asbestos rated at more than 0.1 fibers per cubic centimeter (f/cc) of air, averaged over an 8-hour period (Permissible Exposure Limit, PEL). Only fibers longer than 5 microns are counted.
- The short-term or excursion maximum is 1.0 f/cc air averaged over a 30-minute period.
- The possibility of exposure above these values requires caution signs, protective clothing, a change room, and notification of both the employee and the Chief of DOSH.
- An employer is responsible for ensuring that the air at the jobsite is monitored for asbestos when the concentration may be more than 0.1 f/cc of air averaged over an 8-hour period. The monitoring must be repeated every 6 months if the concentration may be more than 0.5 f/cc per 8 hours.
- Monitoring/medical records must be kept for at least 30 years.

### Flammable Vapors
- Ventilation in enclosed places must be sufficient to prevent flammable vapor concentration from exceeding 25% of the lower explosive limit (the leanest mixture at which an explosion will occur when ignited).
- No source of ignition (including smoking) is permitted where vapor concentrations may be reasonably expected to exceed 25% of this lower explosive limit.

### Confined Space
A confined space is defined as an area where:
- The existing ventilation does not remove air contaminants or replace oxygen-deficient air.
- Ready access, exit, or removal of a suddenly-disabled employee is difficult.

Before employees are allowed to enter confined spaces (e.g., tanks, vats, boilers, ducts, etc.), the air must be tested for contamination and oxygen deficiency:
- Contamination may be due to:
  - Flammability of a gas or vapor (a concentration greater than 20% of its lower explosive/flammable limit).
  - Presence of a combustible particulate (a concentration greater than 20% of the minimum explosive concentration).
  - A poisonous substance present at a level immediately hazardous to life or health.
- Oxygen Deficiency is defined as air in which the concentration of oxygen is less than 19.5% by volume.

Ventilation is required if testing reveals a hazard. Working in a confined space where dangerous air contamination exists requires:
- Appropriate respiratory protection.
- A safety harness attached to a retrieval line and equipment.
- One employee standing by with a respirator, trained in CPR.
- One additional employee within sight or call.
- Effective means of communication between the employee in the confined space and the stand-by employee.
- On-going atmospheric testing.
- Provisions for ready entry and exit where feasible.

### First Aid
- First aid kits must be provided at all job sites.
- Emergency medical services must be readily available.
- Personnel trained and immediately available to provide first aid treatment must be provided.
- Trained personnel must possess a current Red Cross (First Aid) certificate or its equivalent.
- Personnel responsible for administering first aid must be provided with protection from bloodborne pathogens.

### Sanitation
- An adequate supply of potable (drinkable) water must be provided at each job site.
- One toilet must be provided for every 15 employees or fraction thereof; urinals may be substituted for up to half of the units.
  - For less than 5 employees, separate facilities for each gender are not required if the facilities can be locked from the inside and contain at least one toilet.
  - Toilets are not required for mobile crews, provided that transportation is available to toilets nearby.
  - Toilets must be kept clean and provided with toilet paper.
- One washing station must be provided for every 15 employees or fraction thereof.
  - Washing stations must be kept clean, have an adequate supply of water, soap, and single-use towels or a warm-air blower.
  - They must be located so that any time a toilet is used, the user can readily wash.

### Fire Protection, Prevention, and Fighting
- The employer is responsible for establishing an effective fire prevention program.
- Portable fire extinguishers must be inspected monthly and serviced annually.
- They must be placed within 75 feet of work areas.
- Carbon tetrachloride, chlorobromomethane, and methyl bromide fire extinguishers are prohibited in California because they are poisonous.

**Extinguisher Types and Uses:**
| Extinguisher Type | Extinguishes                                                                 |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A                 | Ordinary combustibles: Fires of solid materials such as wood, paper, cloth, trash, etc. Fires of this class require cooling and quenching (preferably aimed at their base) to extinguish. |
| B                 | Flammable liquids: Fires of combustible liquids such as grease, oil, and paints. Fires of this class require blanketing or smothering to extinguish. |
| C                 | Electrical: Electrical fires in energized motors, switches, etc. Fires of this class require an agent that does not conduct electricity, so do not use water or you may become part of the circuit. When the electrical equipment is de-energized, Class A or B extinguishers can be used safely. |
| D                 | Combustible metals: Fires of combustible metals such as magnesium, lithium, potassium, titanium, zirconium, and sodium shavings, dusts, or solids. Fires of this class require blanketing or smothering to extinguish, typically by granular dry powder (not dry chemical) extinguishers. In the USA, the extinguishers themselves are painted yellow, not red. |
| K                 | Cooking fires: High-temperature fires of cooking fats and oils. Equipment that requires Type K extinguishers includes commercial fryers, griddles, and stovetop frying pans (a lid helps greatly). Fires of this class require blanketing and heat reduction. Class B extinguishers are not effective on these high-temperature fires. Class K extinguishers usually contain a fine wet alkaline mist, which turns the oils into a soapy foam that smothers the fire. |

- Inspect the area for hazards from moving ground.
- Inspect the excavation after every rainstorm, earthquake, or other events that may have increased the level of hazard.
- Inspect the face, banks, and top daily when workers are exposed to falling or rolling material.
- Remove trees, poles, or boulders that may pose a hazard.

#### Regulations by Depth
- **2 feet or more:** You must deposit excavated materials ("spoils") at least 2 feet from the edge of the excavation so they won't fall back.
- **4 feet or more:**
  - Provide a safe way for workers to enter and leave the excavation (e.g., ladders) within 25 feet of any work area: a minimum of every 50 feet at a large site.
  - If soil conditions are unstable, you must slope, support, or shore excavations of any depth.

- Do not slope a shored trench greater than 15° from the vertical.
- In trenches, always use at least two braces.
- Use metal screw-type trench jacks with a base or horizontal timber at each end. Hydraulic jacks are also permitted (and are safer in many cases).
- Shoring and bracing are required in clay, silt, loam, or mixed soils.
- The longer a trench is left unsupported, the greater the chance of a cave-in.
- Remove shoring from the bottom up: release jacks or braces slowly; in unstable soil, pull them out with ropes.

### Guardrails
- Open sides of all work surfaces 7-1/2 feet high or higher must be guarded by railings or periphery cables, or else workers must be protected by safety belts or nets.
- Floor and roof openings in any work surface must be covered or guardrailed.
- Covers must bear a warning sign.
- A wall opening must be guarded if it is lower than 3 feet above the surface and the drop is more than 4 feet.

  - Safety nets.
- If temporary flooring is used, floors must be planked every other floor.
- If the fall distance is greater than 15 feet, safety belts or nets are required.

#### Requirements for Other Buildings
- Every floor must be solidly planked (sub-floored, formed, or concrete-filled) before work starts on the floor above, or before joists are installed.

### Personal Fall Arrest Systems/Personal Fall Restraint Systems
- Safety lines and lifelines must be able to support 5,000 pounds.

### How to Bid for Profit

#### Sample Bidding Questions
- **Scenario:**
  - Direct Cost (Labor and Material): $1,000.
  - Contractor’s Business Overhead Percentage: 25%.
  - Desired Profit: 5%.
- **Question:** What should the contractor’s bid be?

#### Sample Bidding Question Answer
- **Calculation:**
  - Direct Costs: $1,000.
  - 25% Overhead + 5% Profit = 30%.
  - 100% - 30% = 70%.
  - $1,000 ÷ 70% = $1,428.57.
- **Answer:** $1,428.57.
- **Proof:**
  - $1,428.57 × 70% = $1,000.00 (Direct Cost).
  - $1,428.57 × 25% = $357.14 (Overhead).
  - $1,428.57 × 5% = $71.43 (Profit).
  - Total: $1,428.57.

#### Practice Question
- **Problem:**
  - Direct Cost: $2,500.
  - Overhead: 15%.
  - Profit: 5%.
- **Answer:** $3,125.

### Building Codes

#### Overview
- **Definition:** A set of regulations ensuring safe construction in a jurisdiction, typically in book form.
- **Specifications:** Includes minimum size and spacing of lumber for wall framing, steepness of stairs, and fire rating of critical components.
- **Enforcement:** Local building department enforces local codes; state codes often require local codes to be at least as strict.
- **Adoption:** Most small cities and counties adopt the state code as their own.

#### Additional Codes
- Plumbing codes.
- Mechanical codes.
- Fire protection codes.
- Electrical codes.
- Energy provisions.
- **Note:** Most workers on-site don’t refer to codes frequently; architects and engineers ensure compliance in designs. Plumbers, HVAC technicians, and electricians refer to their codes often, especially in residential construction, to calculate loads and meet requirements.

#### Code Text
- **Residential Code for One- and Two-Family Dwellings:** Applies to construction, alteration, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, equipment, use and occupancy, location, removal, and demolition of detached one- and two-family dwellings and townhouses not more than three stories above grade plane in height with separate means of egress, and their accessory structures not more than three stories above grade plane in height. Fully regulated for building, plumbing, mechanical, electrical, and energy provisions.
- **CSLB Testing:** Does not test on building codes but on trade standards.

#### Construction Trends
- **Importance:** Awareness of new technologies, methods, and thinking is crucial for a contractor’s career, alongside safety and ethical practices.
- **Key Trends:**
  - **Disaster Mitigation:** Strengthening buildings for earthquakes, floods, fires, and winds through actions like improved wall bracing and moisture management, increasingly required by regulations and requested by owners/insurers.
  - **Maintenance:** Preservation is a top priority for property owners; maintenance is the most expensive recurring cost after initial construction (excluding remodeling). Preventive/scheduled maintenance (e.g., changing air filters) improves ROI, extends equipment life, and reduces repair costs.

#### Maintenance (Continued)
- **Developments:** Improved techniques, durable materials, better moisture/air management assemblies, and higher-quality work. Resources include training videos, classes, manufacturer training, publications, and certification programs.
- **Building Modeling:** Uses computer and IT tools (e.g., CAD, CAM, energy modeling, project management software, BIM) to design, simulate, and manage buildings. Software proficiency is becoming mandatory.
- **Energy-Efficient or Green Building:** Focuses on minimizing environmental impact through planning, design, construction, and maintenance.
  - **Occupant Health and Safety:** Indoor air quality influenced by paints, sealants, moisture management, and long-term care affecting pets, damage, and mold.
  - **Water Conservation and Efficiency:** Collecting/reusing water (e.g., rainwater for irrigation, low-flush toilets, greywater systems), especially in drought-prone areas.
  - **Low-Impact Development:** Minimizing site disturbance using stormwater techniques, foundation treatments, and landscaping preservation.
  - **Material Efficiency:** Reducing waste, using renewable/recycled materials wisely, and recycling leftovers.
  - **Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Sources:** Incorporating renewable sources (e.g., solar photovoltaics, passive solar) and efficient envelopes/equipment to reduce utility costs.

#### Staying Informed
- **Resources:** Trade/company magazines, online resources, blogs, government/university research.

#### Repair and Residential Maintenance
- **Definition:** Troubleshooting and resolving issues by repairing/replacing defective components or appliances, typically without permits (verify if required). Does not affect property value.
- **Common Issues:**
  - Worn, consumed, dull, dirty, or clogged amenities.
  - Broken or damaged amenities.
  - General upkeep and maintenance.

#### New Construction
- **Definition:** Enhancing a building by adding space or changing areas, requiring a permit and affecting property value.

#### Remodeling
- **Definition:** Renovating to improve an existing structure, sometimes involving new construction. Often affects property value and may require permits.

#### Demolition and Deconstruction
- **Demolition:** Removing parts of a structure with little/no preservation of elements.
- **Deconstruction:** Removing parts with the goal of preserving elements for reuse.

#### Design and Construction Error Identification
- **Overview:** Errors affect cost, schedule, safety, and performance despite rules and standards. Costs are rarely measured but appear as change orders, claims, rework, or non-conformance due to design/contractual deficiencies.

#### Field Inspection Performance
- **Role:** Inspectors analyze, monitor, and approve projects based on city, state, federal, and environmental laws using knowledge of materials and codes.
- **Training:** On-the-job, apprenticeship, or formal education; expertise shown through certification/licensure.
- **Tasks:** Plan, monitor, direct projects; inspect for industry standards/law compliance; review codes, ordinances, zoning, blueprints, and sites.
- **Specializations:** Electrical, plan examination, HVAC, plumbing, or all areas.

---

### Project Coordination

#### Overview
- **Definition:** Day-to-day task management to streamline workflow. Project managers assign responsibilities and deadlines.

#### The Construction Process (Coordination and Control)
- **Budget:** Estimate becomes the project budget; poor planning/scheduling increases costs and reduces profits.
- **Estimation:** Job broken into a schedule for labor hours; construction requires timely material and labor coordination.
- **Delays:** Delay in one task delays the project; managers focus on critical tasks to ensure timely completion, saving contractor time.

#### Production Scheduling Methods
1. **Bar Chart Method:**
   - Fundamental technique showing task start/finish times graphically.
   - Simple but overlooks interrelated tasks.
2. **Critical Path Method (CPM):**
   - Complex tool integrating tasks via a key path accounting for all tasks to be completed.

#### Bar Method Example
- **Work Description and Scheduled Dates (April-May-June):**
  1. Excavate foundation.
  2. Pour footings.
  3. Pour foundation.
  4. Framing.
  5. Construct chimney.

- **Grounded Circuit:** Excessive current via unintended ground path; not a short circuit.
- **Open Circuit:** No path between power source terminals.
- **Grounding Conductor:** Extra conductor to prevent shock if hot conductor contacts appliance case/frame.

#### Direct Current (DC)
- **Flow:** One direction; electrons move from negative to positive.
- **Applications:** Converted from AC or produced locally (e.g., batteries).

#### Alternating Current (AC)
- **Flow:** Rapidly reverses direction due to changing charge at source.
- **Advantages:**
  - Economical for long-distance transmission.
  - Voltage easily stepped up/down for varied uses.
  - Enables high-voltage lines with less current, smaller wires, material savings.
- **Primary Use:** Public electrical energy.

#### Electrical Units of Measurement
- **Voltage (V):** Electrical force (emf); difference in potential causing electron movement; measured in volts.
- **Resistance:** Opposition to current flow; low in conductors, high in poor conductors; measured in ohms (1 ohm = 1 volt pushes 1 amp).

  - **Ohm (Ω):** Resistance to flow.

#### The Electrical Circuit
- **Components:** Power source, conductor, load, switch.
- **Example:** Generator (source), wire (conductor), light bulb (load), switch (control).
- **Operation:** Generator produces current (DC: one direction; AC: reversing); wire completes path; bulb converts energy to heat/light; switch opens/closes circuit.

#### Ohm’s Law
- **Relationship:** Voltage = Current × Resistance (E = I × R); 1 volt pushes 1 amp through 1 ohm.
- **DC Circuit:** Voltage inversely proportional to resistance, directly proportional to current.
- **Formulas:**
  - **E = I × R:** Voltage from current and resistance.
  - **I = E / R:** Current from voltage and resistance.
  - **R = E / I:** Resistance from voltage and current.
- **Examples:**
  - Voltage: 30 amps × 500 ohms = 15,000 volts.
  - Current: 120 volts ÷ 0.5 ohms = 60 amps.
  - Resistance: 120 volts ÷ 15 amps = 8 ohms.

#### Wattage
- **Definition:** Rate of work; 1 watt = 1 amp at 1 volt.

  - Insulation types.
  - Conductors in parallel.
  - Wet/dry locations.
  - Marking, max operating temperatures.
  - Permitted use.
  - Direct burial.
  - Ampacity tables.
  - Adjustment/correction factors.
- **Conductor Choice:** Copper is popular in residential use for flexibility, strength, corrosion resistance, and ease of joining.

#### Circuit Components
- **Conductors and Overload Protection:** Key components; must meet equipment requirements per NEC and local codes.

#### Load Calculations (NEC Article 220)
- **Challenges:** Unknown simultaneous appliance use varies by lifestyle.
- **Methods:**
  - Lighting/Receptacles: Volt-amperes per square foot.
  - Small Appliance Circuits (e.g., kitchen, dining): 1,500 volt-amperes per circuit.
  - Larger Appliances (e.g., dryers, ranges, water heaters): Demand factors applied; not used continuously/simultaneously.
- **Outcome:** Steps size branch circuits, feeders, service equipment correctly.

#### American Wire Gauge (AWG)
- **Definition:** U.S. standard for round, solid, nonferrous wire diameters; determines current-carrying capacity.
- **Process:** Wire drawn through dies; higher AWG number = more draws = smaller diameter (e.g., 12 AWG: 0.0808 inches vs. 4 AWG: 0.2043 inches).
- **Key Factor:** Cross-sectional area impacts safe current capacity.

#### Three-Phase System Voltage
- **Line Voltage:** Common levels between hot wires: 208, 230, 240, 277, 440, 575, 600 volts.
- **Neutral Voltage:** If present, hot-to-neutral voltage = line voltage ÷ √3 (1.732).

  - **Screws:** Easier, better hold, no popping; 12-inch spacing; 1-1/4 inch for 1/4 to 5/8-inch drywall; Type S (light-gauge metal), S-12 (heavier-gauge).
  - **Adhesive:** Best for drywall-to-drywall; use with nails/screws for ceilings.
- **Fastener Schedules:** List on drawings (e.g., #6 x 1-1/4 inch screws, 12-inch spacing for living room).

#### Estimating Drywall Materials
- **Panels:** Perimeter ÷ drywall width (e.g., 48 ft ÷ 4 ft = 12 sheets for 10x14 ft room).
- **Fasteners:**
  - Area = Perimeter × Height (e.g., 48 ft × 8 ft = 384 sq ft).
  - Nails: 5-1/4 lb box covers 1,000 sq ft.
  - Screws: (Area ÷ 100) × 70 screws/100 sq ft ÷ 150 screws/lb (e.g., 384 ÷ 100 × 70 ÷ 150 = ~2 lbs).
- **Tape:** Half of sq ft (e.g., 384 ÷ 2 = 192 ft; 4x 60-ft rolls or 1x 250-ft roll).
- **Compound:** 1 gal/200 sq ft (e.g., 384 sq ft = 2 gals per chart: 100-200: 1 gal, 300-400: 2 gals).

#### Installing a Single Layer of Drywall
- **Tools:** Measuring tape, T-square, utility knife, chalk line, straightedge, cordless drill, keyhole saw, 12-inch mud knife, dust mask, 6-inch taping knife, 4-inch corner knife, goggles.
- **Planning:** Minimize joints; horizontal for <8 ft 1 in ceilings (25% fewer joints), vertical for >8 ft 1 in; deliver just before install, space 1-2 ft apart, avoid dragging/dropping.
- **Ceiling Installation:**
  1. Measure/cut first panel from corner; place cut ends against wall; mark fastener lines.
  2. Fasten panel to joists (parallel: full bearing on edges; perpendicular: fasten edges/end crossings); use two people or jacks/deadmen (T-shaped 2x4, 1/4-1/2 inch longer than height).
  3. Continue row from last panel.
  4. Stagger joints in new rows.

---### Installing Drywall on a Wall

#### Procedure (Wall Height < 8 ft 1 in)
1. **Install Top Panel:** Place horizontally at right angles to studs, starting at a corner; press firmly against studs; optionally use drywall adhesive.
2. **Fasten Top Edge:** Secure along top edge, ensuring tight contact with ceiling; apply fasteners to studs.
3. **Measure and Cut Bottom Panel:** Measure distance to floor, cut panel 1/4-inch narrower.
4. **Position Bottom Panel:** Lay against floor, lift into place with a drywall foot lifter.
5. **Secure Bottom Panel:** Fasten to studs with fasteners.

#### Installing Drywall on a Curved Surface
- **Preparation:** Slightly moisten paper and core; stack flat for at least 1 hour.
- **Installation:** Handle moistened drywall carefully to avoid damage; it regains strength when dry.

#### Multilayer Application
- **Base Layer:** Install like single-layer; double-nailing not needed if using nails; ceiling base layer parallel to framing.
- **Face Layer:** Final layer, parallel or perpendicular to framing for fewer joints; offset from base joints by ≥10 inches; attach with nails, screws, or adhesive; max fastener spacing same as single-layer if no adhesive.

#### Installing Drywall on Steel Studs
- **Method:** Use 1-1/4-inch self-tapping screws with a cordless screw gun; start screws partially, then drive past drywall surface without tearing paper.
- **Spacing:** 10-12 inches in middle, 5-8 inches along edges; hold stud’s open side to prevent bending.

#### Quick Drywall Notes
- **Sizes:** Widths: 48, 54 inches; Lengths: 72, 84, 192 inches; Common Thicknesses: 1/2, 5/8 inch.
- **Types:** Moisture-resistant, fire-rated (Type X).
- **Applications:** 1/2-inch for interior walls.
- **Sound:** Fast vibrations = high pitch, slow = low pitch; acoustical insulation isolates bedrooms, living areas, bathrooms; vibrating surfaces transmit sound.

### Controlling Sound and Acoustical Insulation

#### Sound Transmission
- **Sound Transmission Class (STC):** Higher STC = better sound barrier.
- **Impact Noise Rating (INR):** Higher INR = more resistance to impact noise.
- **Ceiling/Floor Insulation:** Increases STC between floors.

#### Acoustical Insulation
- **Purpose:** Reduces sound passage; isolates active areas from quiet ones (e.g., bedrooms, living areas, bathrooms).

#### Sound Absorption
- **Materials:** Acoustical tiles (fiberboard) with holes/fissures absorb sound by trapping waves; used as ceiling or wall panels.

#### Suspended Ceilings
- **Benefits:** Conceal HVAC, electrical, plumbing; allow access; support recessed lighting; often use acoustical tiles.
- **Types:**
  - **Exposed Grid:** Metal mains and tees (2x2, 2x4, 4x4 ft grids) filled with tiles; most common.
  - **Concealed Grid:** Tiles hide grid with grooves; more expensive, harder to maintain.
  - **Bandraster:** Versatile with varied main/tee lengths for patterns.
  - **Suspended Drywall:** Wires/hangers suspend drywall below ceiling; attached to runners/tees/channels with screws.

#### Suspended Ceiling Plans
- **Mains Calculation:** Divide wall length perpendicular to joists by 4 (e.g., 22 ft ÷ 4 = 5 mains); draw on sketch (odd: center main; even: 2 ft apart on either side of center).
- **Tees Calculation:** Divide main length by 2; place first tee at center if odd number.

  - **Compressor:** Raises refrigerant pressure/temperature for heat release.
  - **Condenser:** Ejects heat to outdoor air.
  - **Metering Device:** Reduces pressure/heat post-condenser.

#### Basic Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Formulas
- **Ton of Refrigeration:** 12,000 Btu/hr (288,000 Btu/24 hr); rate of cooling from melting 1 ton of ice in 24 hours.
- **Problem Example:** 
  - Cooling capacity: 1,440,000 Btu/24 hr.
  - Solution: 1,440,000 ÷ 12,000 = 120 tons.
- **EER (Energy Efficiency Ratio):** Cooling Capacity ÷ Power Input (e.g., 24,000 Btu/hr ÷ 3,000 watts = 8.0).

---### Heat Loss Formula (Continued)

#### Heat Loss Formula
- **R-Value:** Measures resistance to heat flow; higher R-value = better insulation. Total R (Rₜ) = sum of individual component R-values (R₁ + R₂ + ...).
- **U-Value (U-Factor):** Reciprocal of Rₜ (U = 1/Rₜ); measures heat transmission.
- **Heat Loss (Q):** Q = U × A × TD (Btu/hr), where:
  - U = U-value.
  - A = Area (sq ft).
  - TD = Temperature difference (°F) between inside and outside.

#### Example Problem
- **Wall:** 12 ft × 12 ft.
- **Components and R-Values:**
  - Outside air film (15 mph wind): 0.17
  - Wood siding: 0.81
  - Plywood sheathing: 0.62
  - Insulation (R-11): 11.00
  - Gypsum board: 0.45
  - Inside air film: 0.68
- **TD:** 52°F
- **Solution:**
  1. Rₜ = 0.17 + 0.81 + 0.62 + 11.00 + 0.45 + 0.68 = 13.73
  2. U = 1/Rₜ = 1/13.73 = 0.073
  3. A = 12 × 12 = 144 sq ft
  4. Q = 0.073 × 144 × 52 = 546.62 Btu/hr

#### Water Vapor Barrier
- Reduces water vapor collection under specific conditions; vapor moves via pressure differences.

#### Surface Condensation
- Occurs on warm side of insulated surfaces below dewpoint; requires sufficient insulation thickness.

#### Heat Resistant Problem (Conductivity)
- **Building:** 70 ft × 100 ft
- **Heat Gain:** 90,000 Btu/hr
- **Roof TD:** 30°F
- **K-Factor:** 0.31 Btu/in
- **Goal:** Reduce to 50,000 Btu/hr
- **Solution:**
  - Btuh = (K × A × TD) / x
  - 65,100 = (7,000 × 0.31 × 30) / x → x = 1.30 in (required)
  - 90,000 = 65,100 / 0.72 → x = 0.72 in (existing)
  - Additional insulation = 1.30 - 0.72 = 0.58 in

### Fundamental Technical Concepts and Formulas: Air Flow
- **Formulas:**
  1. cfm = fpm × area (ft²)
  2. fpm = cfm / area (ft²)
  3. area = cfm / fpm
- **Examples:**
  - 2,000 cfm, 6 ft² → 2,000 / 6 = 333 fpm
  - 333 fpm, 6 ft² → 333 × 6 = 2,000 cfm
  - 2,000 cfm, 333 fpm → 2,000 / 333 = 6 ft²

#### Air Changes
- **Cfm:** (space ft³ × changes/hr) / 60
- **Changes/hr:** (cfm × 60) / space ft³
- **Cfm (min/change):** space ft³ / min per change
- **Examples:**
  - 10 × 10 × 8 ft, 6 changes/hr → (800 × 6) / 60 = 80 cfm
  - 6,000 ft³, 2,000 cfm, 1 change/3 min → (2,000 × 60) / 6,000 = 20 changes/hr (3 min/change meets code)

#### Calculating Total Fan Air
- **Cfm:** room sensible Btu/hr / (1.08 × (room DB - leaving DB))
- **Note:** Excludes latent/outside heat; return air = total cfm - outside air cfm.

#### Pressure Equivalents
- See IMG_2698 for conversions.

#### Temperature Conversions
- **Fahrenheit:** (C × 1.8) + 32 or (9/5 × C) + 32
- **Celsius:** (F - 32) × 0.555 or 5/9 × (F - 32)
- **Examples:**
  - 30°C → (9/5 × 30) + 32 = 86°F
  - 77°F → 5/9 × (77 - 32) = 25°C

### Properties of Water
- Boils: 212°F (100°C) at atmospheric pressure; 275°F at 45 psi.
- Freezes: 32°F (0°C)
- 1 cu ft = 7.84 gal = 62.31 lbs
- 1 gal @ 39.1°F = 8.33 lbs
- 1 ton @ 39.1°F = 36 cu ft
- 1 ft column = 0.433 psi
- Atmospheric pressure: 29.92 in Hg = 33.9 ft water = 14.7 psi
- Specific heat: 1.00
- Specific gravity: 1.00
- **Latent/Sensible Heat:** 
  - Latent: Changes state, not temp (e.g., 144 Btu/lb fusion).
  - Sensible: Changes temp, not state.
- **Example:** 200 gal from 70°F to 10°F ice:
  - 200 × 8.34 = 1,668 lbs
  - Sensible (70-32°F): 1,668 × 1 × 38 = 63,384 Btu
  - Latent (32°F water to ice): 1,668 × 144 = 240,192 Btu
  - Sensible (32-10°F ice): 1,668 × 0.48 × 22 = 17,614 Btu
  - Total: 63,384 + 240,192 + 17,614 = 321,190 Btu

#### Refrigerants

### Weatherization Installation

#### Introduction
- **Purpose:** Weatherization reduces utility costs through insulation, leak detection, and weather stripping, tailored to the structure and application area.

#### Air Leaks and Barriers
- **Importance:** Insulation is key, but leak detection and barriers significantly reduce energy consumption by controlling unconditioned air entry, pollution, and humidity.
- **Air Barrier Requirements:**
  - Resist air movement.
  - Fully surround the building envelope continuously.
  - Be strong, durable, and easy to install.
- **Common Material:** Gypsum board (drywall) with taped seams; sealed with continuous sealant at exterior wall plates, ceiling plates, penetrations, rough openings, and first interior stud of partition walls.

#### Weather Stripping
- **Purpose:** Seals air leaks around windows/doors.
- **Calculation Example:** For four windows:
  - **Dimensions:**
    - Window 1 & 2 (Living Room): 45" (left/right jamb) + 24" (header/sill) = 138" each.
    - Window 3 (Living Room): 65" (left/right jamb) + 36" (header/sill) = 202".
    - Window 4 (Living Room): 85" (left/right jamb) + 48" (header/sill) = 266".
  - **Perimeter Total:** 138" + 138" + 202" + 266" = 744".
  - **Add 10% Waste:** 744" × 0.10 = 74.4"; Total = 744" + 74.4" = 818.4".
  - **Convert to Feet:** 818.4" ÷ 12 = 68.2 ft.
- **Factors for Selection:** Friction, weather exposure, durability, wear/tear, cost.

#### Types of Insulation
- **Factors:** Heating/cooling loads depend on occupant lifestyle and building materials; insulation choice impacts efficiency.
- **Common Types:**
  - **Blanket (Batts and Rolls):** Mineral fiber/rock wool; versatile for unfinished walls, floors, ceilings; various widths/thicknesses/R-values.
  - **Foam Board (Rigid Insulation):** Polystyrene, polyisocyanurate, polyurethane; high heat resistance, adds strength/stability; used anywhere in structure.

#### Crawlspaces
- **Advantages:** Elevates structure against termites/water, houses serviceable plumbing/ducts; requires insulation/ventilation to prevent mold/heat transfer.
- **Ventilation/Drainage:** Needs proper ventilation and drainage (trench, perforated pipe, gravel) to manage moisture.
- **Foam Board Types:**
  - **Molded Expanded Polystyrene (MEPS):** 3.8-4.4 R/inch; used in cups to insulation.
  - **Extruded Expanded Polystyrene:** Higher R-value, costlier; ideal for roofs/walls.
  - **Polyisocyanurate/Polyurethane:** Up to 8 R/inch, stable under compression/-100°F to +250°F; excellent for roofing.

##### Insulating an Unventilated Crawlspace
- **Benefits:** Less insulation needed, pipes/ducts in conditioned space.
- **Steps:**
  1. Seal air leaks/penetrations (e.g., band joist).
  2. Insulate access door with weather stripping (shape-retaining).
  3. Insulate masonry walls and door with rigid foam/batts, band joist with batts.
  4. Install termite shield between foundation and band joist (if possible); leave 2-4 inch gap for inspection if not.

##### Insulating a Ventilated Crawlspace
- **Steps:**
  1. Seal floor cracks/holes to prevent infiltration.
  2. Apply fiberglass batts between floor joists, stapled tight to subfloor, seal seams.
  3. Cover with house wrap (vapor barrier), seal/tape seams.

#### Attics
- **Inspection:** Easiest area to check; add insulation if joists visible (aim for 10-14 inches, ~R-38).
- **Mixing Insulation:** Can combine types (e.g., loose fill over batts).
- **Steps:**
  1. **Plug Holes:** Fill stud cavities with 16-inch fiberglass pieces.
  2. **Seal Dropped Soffits:**
     - Remove insulation.
     - Cut foil-backed insulation slightly oversized, caulk around opening, staple in place.
  3. **Seal Kneewalls:** Place 24-inch fiberglass pieces in joist spaces.
  4. **Seal Furnace Flues:**
     - Check codes/manufacturer (min 1-inch clearance from combustibles).
     - Fit aluminum flashing (two overlapping pieces), caulk seams/edges, secure.
     - Seal flashing-flue gap with high-temp caulk.
     - Install insulation dam (aluminum with slots), secure, insulate up to dam.
  5. **Seal Attic Hatch:** Apply self-adhesive foam weather stripping, cover with batt/foam.
- **Ventilation:** Keep vented soffits clear.

#### Duct Insulation
- **Purpose:** Prevents heat gain (summer) or loss (winter) in unconditioned spaces; insulate if >15°F difference between supply air and surrounding air.
- **Types:**
  - **Fiberglass Ducts:** Built-in insulation.
  - **Metal Ducts:** External (foil/vinyl-backed, lapped/stapled/taped) or internal (glued/welded during fabrication).

#### HVAC Duct and Air Leaks
- **Inspection Areas:** Air handler seams, supply/return plenums, trunk lines, wood-formed ducts, branch joints, register/grille connections.
- **Sealing:** Use special tape or mastic (thick paste, applied with brush, dries hard/pliable).

#### Mold
- **Definition:** Fungi breaking down organic matter, producing airborne spores with health risks.
- **Common U.S. Species:** Cladosporium, Penicillium, Aspergillus, Alternaria; Aspergillus/Penicillium are toxin-producing; Stachybotrys chartarum linked to sick building syndrome.

#### Blown-In Loose-Fill Insulation
- **Benefits:** Conforms to any space, ideal for new/existing structures.
- **Materials/R-Values:**
  - Cellulose: 3.2-3.8 R/inch (10-12 inches for R-38).
  - Fiberglass: 2.2-2.7 R/inch (14-17 inches for R-38); only type for 1/2-inch drywall on 24-inch centers.
  - Rock Wool: 3.0-3.3 R/inch (11.5-13 inches for R-38).
- **Compatibility:** All fine with 1/2-inch drywall on 16-inch centers or 5/8-inch on 24-inch centers.

#### Sprayed-Foam and Foamed-In-Place Insulation
- **Versatility:** Injected, poured, or sprayed; ~2× R-value of batts per inch.

#### Water Heater Blankets
- **Benefits:** Reduces energy use by 4-9%; suitable for electric/combustion heaters.

#### Determine Air Leaks without a Blower Door Test
- **Areas to Check:** Material junctions, foundation-walls, chimney-siding, mail chutes, utility/cable/wire/plumbing/vent penetrations, siding-foundation, HVAC systems, fans.

#### Insulating Hot Water Pipes
- **Purpose:** Saves 2-4°F heat loss.
- **Method:** Use polyethylene/neoprene foam sleeves, slit facing down, tape every foot; keep 6-8 inches from gas heater flue.

#### Sealing Switches and Outlets
- **Purpose:** Reduces heat transfer on exterior walls.
- **Method:** Apply precut outlet/switch sealers.

### Concrete

#### Mixing Concrete by Hand
- **Tools:** Mortar hoe, mixing trough/mud pan, bucket, 1-quart container, utility knife.
- **Materials:** Concrete mix (80-lb bag = ~0.6 cu ft).
- **Considerations:**
  - Calculate needs (e.g., 10×10 ft × 4 in slab = 55 80-lb bags; rent mixer for large jobs).
  - Match mix to application (basic for posts, high-strength for driveways; avoid mortar mix).
  - Cure 3-5 days with moisture (mist/curing compound).
  - Use 10-lb bags for small jobs.
- **Steps:**
  1. Cut bag in trough, empty upwind (wear gloves/goggles/respirator).
  2. Make indentation, add 2/3 water, mix with hoe, add remaining water for peanut butter consistency (test with gloved hand squeeze).
  3. Work dry pockets into wet mix, avoid excess water.

#### The Slump Test
- **Purpose:** Measures cohesiveness/uniformity; wet mix slumps more, dry mix may crumble.
- **Tools:** 5/8" dia., 24" tamping rod; 12" high cone (4" top, 8" base).
- **Method:** Fill cone, rod to remove air, lift cone, measure slump (12" - settled height); 3-4" typical, 6" acceptable.
- **Consistency:** Higher slump = wetter mix; test ensures batch uniformity.

#### Steps in Concrete Finishing
1. **Screeding:** Strike off to grade post-placement; use straight-edged wood/metal with sawing motion or power tool; remove stakes progressively.
2. **Bullfloating/Darbying:** Smooth post-screeding to fill voids/level ridges/embed aggregate; darbies for small areas, bullfloats (non-conductive handles) for large; cut 1" from forms, wait for 1/4" foot indentation before next steps.
3. **Edging:** Round edges with steel/bronze edger to resist chipping.
4. **Jointing/Grooving:** Install contraction/expansion joints with groover/jointer/saw; expansion joints full slab depth, 1/4-1/2" thick at stress points.
5. **Floating:** Apply even texture post-water sheen with hand float (metal/wood/plastic) to embed aggregate/remove imperfections/compact; optional final finish for skid resistance.
6. **Troweling:** Smooth/harden post-floating with steel trowel; multiple passes (smaller trowels, angled blade) for density/wear resistance.
7. **Brooming:** Roughen post-floating/troweling with damp broom for non-slip surface (perpendicular to traffic).

#### Admixtures
- **Definition:** Materials (not cement/aggregate/water) added pre-/during mixing to enhance properties (workability, strength, durability, etc.).
- **Types:**
  - **Air-Entraining:** Adds tiny air bubbles (1-3 thousandths inch) via admixture or cement; improves freeze-thaw resistance, workability, de-icer/sulfate resistance, watertightness.
  - **Water-Reducing:** Lowers water needed for given slump/consistency.
  - **Retarding:** Slows hydration for placement/consolidation in hot weather.
  - **Accelerating:** Speeds setting/strength (e.g., calcium chloride ≤2% cement weight, not for prestressed/aluminum/galvanized/sulfate-exposed concrete).
  - **Pozzolans:** Siliceous/aluminous materials forming cementitious compounds with calcium hydroxide; variable effects.
  - **Workability Agents:** Improve fresh concrete flow (e.g., entrained air, organic materials).
  - **Dampproofing/Permeability-Reducing:** Reduce capillary moisture flow (water-repellents, pozzolans).
  - **Gas-Forming:** Cause slight expansion pre-hardening (e.g., aluminum powder).
